cd zaika-vault

Run with Docker Compose:

docker-compose up --build

Access the App:

Frontend: http://localhost:3000

Option 2: Manual Setup (Local) 💻

Install Dependencies (Root, Frontend & Backend):

npm run install-all

Environment Variables:
Create a .env file in the Backend/ folder:

# Add other API keys (OpenAI, Cloudinary, etc.)

Start Development Servers:

npm run dev

(This runs both Frontend and Backend concurrently)

🔍 Code Quality & Commands

This project enforces strict code quality standards using Husky hooks.

Command

Description

npm run dev

Starts both Frontend and Backend in dev mode.

npm run lint-all

Runs ESLint on both projects.

git commit

We use Commitlint. Your commit messages must follow the Conventional Commits standard:
